# ft_printf
The ft_printf project involved recoding the printf() function in C. This project was of moderate difficulty and allowed me to improve my programming skills. The key to a successful ft_printf was a well-structured and extensible code. Once the assignment passed, I added my ft_printf() to my libft so that I can use it in my future school C projects.

The goal of the project was to create a library that contained ft_printf(), a function that mimics the original printf(). The ft_printf() function had to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

During the project, I learned  about the variadic function, it's make you using a variable number of arguments in a function.
