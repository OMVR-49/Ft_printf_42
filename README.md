# ft_printf

The ft_printf project involved recoding the printf() function in C. This project was of moderate difficulty and allowed me to improve my programming skills. The key to a successful ft_printf was a well-structured and extensible code. Once the assignment passed, I added my ft_printf() to my libft so that I can use it in my future school C projects.

The goal of the project was to create a library that contained ft_printf(), a function that mimics the original printf(). The ft_printf() function had to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%

During the project, I learned  about the variadic function, it's make you using a variable number of arguments in a function.

## Key Learnings:

1. **Variadic Functions:** Gain proficiency in handling a variable number of arguments in C through the implementation of printf().
2. **Programming Skills Enhancement:** The project serves as an opportunity to enhance programming skills, particularly in C.
3. **Norm Compliance:** Adhere to coding standards (Norm) for consistency and good coding practices.
4. **Memory Management:** Learn and practice proper memory management, avoiding unexpected exits and memory leaks.
5. **Makefile Usage:** Understand and implement Makefiles, including necessary rules and flags for compilation.
6. **Libft Integration:** Successfully integrate ft_printf() into the libft library for use in future C projects.
7. **Conversion Handling:** Implement conversions for cspdiuxX%, mimicking the behavior of the original printf().
8. **Library Creation:** Use the ar command to create the libftprintf.a library.
10. **Submission Protocol:** Follow the submission protocol, including the use of a git repository for grading.

**Version Control:** Version 10

**Project Difficulty:** Moderate
